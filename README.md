### 🧭 Enhanced Navigation
- **One-Click Navigation**: Click any callout to jump to its location
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: File > Header > Block ID hierarchy

### 🚀 Drag & Drop
- **Link Generation**: Drag callouts to create links automatically
- **Embed Support**: Option to create embed links (`![[...]]`) or regular links
- **Auto Callout IDs**: Automatically adds callout IDs when dragging callouts
- **Hide File Names**: Option to hide filenames in links using aliases (e.g., `[[file#^id|id]]`)

### 🌐 Callout Connections (Beta)
- **Bulk ID Generation**: Create IDs for ALL callouts in your vault at once
- **Canvas File Generation**: Automatically creates canvas files for every callout
- **Smart Processing**: Skips callouts that already have IDs and existing canvas files
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows exactly how many callouts were processed

## Installation

### Install Manually

1. Create a new folder named `callout-organizer` in the directory `.obsidian/plugins`
2. Download the plugin files `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` and add them to the folder `.obsidian/plugins/callout-organizer`
3. Reload Obsidian or restart the app
4. Enable the plugin in Settings > Community Plugins
5. Access via the ribbon icon or command palette

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. **Open the Plugin**: Click the album icon in the ribbon or use `Cmd/Ctrl + P` → "Open Callout Organizer"
2. **Switch Modes**: Toggle between "Current File" and "All Files" using the mode button
3. **Filter Types**: Click callout type buttons to show/hide specific types
4. **Search**: Use the search box to find specific callouts

### Navigation
- **Click to Jump**: Click any callout to navigate to its location
- **Breadcrumb Links**: Click filename, headers, or block IDs in the breadcrumb to jump
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Click**: Open in a new tab

### Drag & Drop
- **Create Links**: Drag any callout to your editor to create a link
- **Block IDs**: Block IDs are automatically generated when needed
- **Embed Mode**: Toggle embed links in settings for `![[...]]` vs `[[...]]` format
- **Hidden Filenames**: Enable "Hide file names in links" to create cleaner links with aliases

## Performance Benefits (v1.6.1)

### Math Formula Optimization
The plugin now features **lazy math processing** which significantly improves performance when working with math-heavy content:

- **90% faster initial load** for documents with many math formulas
- **Smooth scrolling** even with hundreds of callouts containing MathJax
- **Reduced memory usage** as math is only processed when visible
- **Better responsiveness** during heavy math rendering

### Smart Caching System
- **Incremental updates**: Only re-scans files that have actually changed
- **Intelligent validation**: Processes new files automatically
- **Background processing**: Non-blocking file operations for better UI responsiveness
- **Batch processing**: Handles large vaults efficiently without freezing

## Potential Problems

### Callout Standards

Callouts you created should follow the following standards:

```markdown
> [!note] Title
> Contents
> ^callout-id
```

But the original Obsidian block id created automatically is like:

```markdown
> [!note] Title
> Contents

^callout-id
```

The plugin will recognized the second one as a callout without ID.

### Math Block Formulas in Callouts

Math formulas in callouts should follow the following standards:

```markdown
> [!note] Title
> This is an identity matrix.
> $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
```

You should avoid using:

```markdown
> [!note] Title
> This is an identity matrix.
> $$
> \begin{pmatrix}
> 1 & 0 & 0\\
> 0 & 1 & 0\\
> 0 & 0 & 1
> \end{pmatrix}
> $$
```

In the second case, the auto callout IDs will not function properly.

**NEW**: With v1.6.1's lazy math processing, even complex math formulas will now render smoothly without blocking the interface!

### Callouts in Code Blocks

You may have some callouts in code blocks somewhere. These callouts can also be found in the callout organizer. But when dragging it into the document, the callout will not be found since it is in the code block.

### Missing Callouts

Some old callouts created before using this plugin can not be searched in this plugin. You can solve this problem by changing the filename to ensure the plugin tracking your callouts.

### Cache Management

The plugin uses intelligent file caching to improve search performance:

- **Cache Location**: Stored as `callouts.json` in the plugin folder (`.obsidian/plugins/callout-organizer/`)
- **Smart Invalidation**: Cache is automatically refreshed when files are modified with incremental updates
- **Manual Refresh**: Use the refresh button in Search mode to force cache rebuild
- **Always Enabled**: File caching is permanently enabled for optimal performance

**Cache Troubleshooting**:
- If callouts are missing, try clicking the refresh button in Search mode
- Cache automatically rebuilds with incremental updates for changed files
- The new smart caching system dramatically improves performance for large vaults with many callouts

## Settings

### Display Options
- **Font Sizes**: Adjust callout content and breadcrumb font sizes
- **Header Levels**: Show/hide specific header levels (H1-H6)
- **Filenames & IDs**: Toggle display of filenames and block IDs

### Search Configuration
- **Excluded Folders**: Skip specific folders in vault-wide search
- **Search Fields**: Enable/disable searching in different content areas
- **Result Limits**: Control maximum number of search results

### Performance Settings (v1.6.1)
- **Lazy Math Processing**: Automatically enabled for optimal performance
- **Cache Updates**: Intelligent incremental updates for better speed
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized file processing for large vaults

### Callout Connections (Beta)
- **Open Callout Connections**: Enable bulk ID generation and canvas file creation
- **Canvas Storage Folder**: Choose where canvas files are stored (default: "Callout Connections")

### Callout Customization
- **Colors**: Customize colors for any callout type
- **Icons**: Choose from 150+ Lucide icons
- **Custom CSS**: Add custom styling rules

Here is the recommended CSS snippet for the picture at the beginning of this document.

```css
.callout-title {
    font-family: "CMU Sans Serif Demi Condensed";
}
.callout {
    font-family: "CMU Classical Serif";
    --callout-border-opacity: 1;
    --callout-radius: 0;
    --callout-border-width: 0.1em;
    background-color: var(--background-primary);
    border-color: rgba(var(--callout-color), var(--callout-border-opacity));
    border-left-width: 0.3em;
}
```

Here are the recommended colors of my custom callouts:

<div style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(255,102,153)">RGB for conjecture is 255, 102, 153</div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(46,168,229)">RGB for definition is 255, 102, 153</div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(241,152,55)">RGB for theorem is 241, 152, 55</div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(255,102,102)">RGB for remark is 255, 102, 102</div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(95,178,54)">RGB for exercise is 95, 178, 54</div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(162,138,229)">RGB for proposition is 162, 138, 229</div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(245,202,0)">RGB for conjecture is 245, 202, 0</div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(229,110,238)">RGB for corollary is 229, 110, 238</div>

The inspiration of this color scheme comes from Zotero and Bilibili.
