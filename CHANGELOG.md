- **Removed Unused Features**: Cleaned up interface by removing "Group by Type" setting
- **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Consistent indentation and logical grouping throughout settings

### 🔧 Technical Enhancements
- **Advanced Math Rendering**: Enhanced LaTeX/MathJax processing with better timing and error handling
